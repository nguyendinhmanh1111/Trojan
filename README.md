# Trojan
One of the older and potentially widely misunderstood forms of malware is the Trojan. Simply put, a Trojan is a software application that is designed to provide covert access to avictim’s system. The malicious code is packaged in such a way that it appears harmless and thus gets around both the scrutiny of the user and the antivirus or other applications that are looking for malware. Once on a system, its goals are similar to those of a virus or worm: to get and maintain control of the system or perform some other task.
### A Trojan infection may be indicated by some of the following behaviors
* The CD drawer of a computer opens and closes.
* The computer screen changes, either flipping or inverting.
* Screen settings change by themselves.
* Documents print with no explanation.
* The browser is redirected to a strange or unknown web page.
* The Windows color settings change.
* Screen saver settings change.
* The right and left mouse buttons reverse their functions.
* The mouse pointer disappears.
* The mouse pointer moves in unexplained ways.
* The Start button disappears.
* Chat boxes appear.
* The Internet service provider (ISP) reports that the victim’s computer is running port
scans.
* People chatting with you appear to know detailed personal information about you.
* The system shuts down by itself.
* The taskbar disappears.
* Account passwords are changed.
* Legitimate accounts are accessed without authorization.
* Unknown purchase statements appear on credit card bills.
* Modems dial and connect to the Internet by themselves.
* Ctrl+Alt+Del stops working

### Types of Trojans include the following
* #### Remote Access Trojans (RATs)
Designed to give an attacker remote control over a victim’s system. Two well-known members of this class are the SubSeven program and its
cousin, Back Orifice, although both are older examples.
* #### Data Sending 
To fit into this category, a Trojan must capture some sort of data from the victim’s system, including files and keystrokes. Once captured, this data can be
transmitted via email or other means if the Trojan is so enabled. Keyloggers are common
Trojans of this type.
* #### Destructive 
This type of Trojan seeks to corrupt, erase, or destroy data outright on a system. In more extreme cases, the Trojan may affect the hardware in such a way that it
becomes unusable.
* #### Proxy 
Malware of this type causes a system to be used as a proxy by the attacker. The attacker uses the victim’s system to scan or access another system or location. The result
is that the actual attacker is hard to find.
* #### FTP 
Software in this category is designed to set up the infected system as an FTP server. An infected system becomes a server hosting all sorts of information, which may include
illegal content of all types.
### Examples of Trojan malware attacks
Trojan malware attacks can inflict a lot of damage. At the same time, Trojans continue to evolve. Here are three examples.

1. **Rakhni Trojan**.This malware has been around since 2013. More recently, it can deliver ransomware or a cryptojacker (allowing criminals to use your device to mine for cryptocurrency) to infected computers. “The growth in coin mining in the final months of 2017 was immense,” the 2018 Internet Security Threat Report notes. “Overall coin-mining activity increased by 34,000 percent over the course of the year.”
2. **ZeuS/Zbot**.This banking Trojan is another oldie but baddie. ZeuS/Zbot source code was first released in 2011. It uses keystroke logging — recording your keystrokes as you log into your bank account, for instance — to steal your credentials and perhaps your account balance as well.

### How to help protect against Trojans
* Computer security begins with installing and running an internet security suite. Run periodic diagnostic scans with your software. You can set it up so the program runs scans automatically during regular intervals.
* Update your operating system’s software as soon as updates are made available from the software company. Cybercriminals tend to exploit security holes in outdated software programs. In addition to operating system updates, you should also check for updates on other software that you use on your computer.
* Protect your accounts with complex, unique passwords. Create a unique password for each account using a complex combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
* Keep your personal information safe with firewalls.
* Back up your files regularly. If a Trojan infects your computer, this will help you to restore your data.
* Be careful with email attachments. To help stay safe, scan an email attachment first. 
* A lot of things you should do come with a corresponding thing not to do — like, do be careful with email attachments and don’t click on suspicious email attachments. Here are some more don’ts.
* Don’t visit unsafe websites. Some internet security software will alert you that you’re about to visit an unsafe site, such as Norton Safe Web.
* Don’t open a link in an email unless you’re confident it comes from a legitimate source. In general, avoid opening unsolicited emails from senders you don’t know.
* Don’t download or install programs if you don’t have complete trust in the publisher.
* Don’t click on pop-up windows that promise free programs that perform useful tasks.
* Don’t ever open a link in an email unless you know exactly what it is.
